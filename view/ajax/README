Most of the backend interface actions happen here. Pressing a button with a wp-crm-view-{action}
class should call {action}.php from within this directory.
In order for this to happen, the action should be attached in scripts/wp-crm.js.
Future idea: to automatically bind wp-crm-view-{action} to {action}.php.

More ideas:
In order for the {action}.php to close the window, should return OK as the first two characters
of the response. Further, the next characters should be a json encoding of the set properties,
(key, value) pairs to allow the browser to update the fields from the same row as the action
button, that have the attribute "rel" set to "key".
