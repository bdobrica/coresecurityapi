Template storage. While in previous version, templates where limited to plain HTML and PDF formats, the new templates can be either ODF documents (ODT, ODS, etc), PDF and PNG images.

Decided to use TinyButStrong template engine with OpenTBS to generate Open/Microsoft Office Files.

template ------	+
		+ - class : contains tbs files (as this are 3rd party libraries should not be included in the main class structure
		+ - default : contains default templates (if tied to a class, the name should be class_name_view.ext)
		+ - custom : a folder containing template variations for each default template, grouped in user folders
